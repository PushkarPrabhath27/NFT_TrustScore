### **Detailed Prompt for Integrating Data into Frontend with Real-Time Analysis, Without Mock Data**

---

### **1. User Input and Real-Time Data Fetching**

* **User Input**: Start with an **input field** where the user can enter the **NFT contract address**.

* **Action on Submission**: When the user submits the contract address, send this address to the **backend** for real-time fetching of NFT contract data.

  **Important**: **No mock data** should be used anywhere in the process. All information that will be presented on the frontend must come **exclusively from the contract address** provided by the user.

* **Loading State**: While the backend is processing the contract address and fetching the necessary data, display a **loading indicator** to inform the user that the system is working on retrieving the analysis.

---

### **2. Data Fetching and Display Flow**

#### **Contract Data Fetching from the Backend**:

* When the contract address is submitted, the system must send the **contract address** to the backend, which should fetch the real-time data:

  * **NFT Collection Data** (collection name, creator, blockchain info, etc.)
  * **Price History and Trends**
  * **Trust Score and Risk Analysis**
  * **Fraud Indicators and Alerts**
  * **Price Predictions and Market Trends**
  * **NFT Asset Data** (e.g., specific NFTs within the collection, their trust scores, and their price history)

#### **Data Integrity**:

* All information that will appear on the frontend must come directly from the backend analysis based on the contract address provided by the user. No static or mock data should be displayed. This ensures that the data is accurate and reflective of the live marketplace.
* The data should be fetched and processed **dynamically** with every new contract address entered, ensuring **real-time updates**.

---

### **3. Visual Presentation of Real-Time Data**

Once the backend has fetched the data for the given contract address, the frontend will display it in an **interactive and user-friendly manner**. Here's how the data should be organized and presented:

#### **Section 1: NFT Overview**

Display basic information about the NFT collection and the specific NFT requested.

* **NFT Name**: Directly fetched from the NFT data.
* **Collection Image**: Display the collection's image (if available).
* **Creator**: Show the creator's address and indicate if it’s verified.
* **Blockchain**: Display the blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.).
* **Trust Score**: Show the current **trust score** as retrieved from the backend.
* **Risk Level**: Visualize the risk level as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** based on the backend data.

#### **Section 2: Price and Market Trends**

Use real-time data for price analysis and trends.

* **Current Price**: Display the most recent price as fetched from the backend (e.g., "2.4 ETH").
* **Price History**: Present a dynamic **line chart** or **bar graph** with real-time price fluctuations over time.
* **Price Predictions**: Include predictions for the next month and three months, based on the model's real-time analysis.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the price of the selected NFT collection with similar collections fetched dynamically.

**Note**: All of this price and trend data will be **fetched and updated in real-time** from the contract address provided, without any reliance on mock or pre-existing data.

#### **Section 3: Trust and Risk Metrics**

These should be fetched and displayed based on the **contract data**.

* **Trust Score**: Show the **real-time trust score** for the NFT collection or asset.
* **Risk Levels**: The risk levels for different factors (such as **market risk**, **creator risk**, **contract risk**) should be displayed dynamically.
* **Risk Indicators**: Use **radar charts** or **bar charts** to visualize the different risk metrics in real time, directly fetched from the backend.

#### **Section 4: Fraud Alerts and Insights**

The system must fetch any fraud-related data from the backend:

* **Fraud Score**: Display the **real-time fraud score**.
* **Fraud Indicators**: Show specific fraud risks such as **Wash Trading**, **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**, and **Metadata Authenticity**.
* **Alert Levels**: Use color-coded indicators to show the alert level of the fraud score.

All fraud data should be **real-time**, based on the contract analysis.

#### **Section 5: Creator and Collection Insights**

* **Creator’s Information**: Show creator details and associated metrics (e.g., **creator trust score**, **verification status**).
* **Collection Insights**: Visualize detailed insights about the NFT collection, including:

  * Trust score distribution.
  * Rarity distribution within the collection.
  * Historical price trends and volume.

All of this data will come from the **real-time backend fetching** based on the contract address.

#### **Section 6: Portfolio Tracking (Optional Feature)**

Allow users to **track their portfolio** with **real-time updates** for each NFT in their collection:

* **NFT Portfolio**: Allow users to add NFTs to their portfolio, and provide **real-time updates** for each asset.
* **Portfolio Value and Risk**: Calculate the total value of the user's assets, along with the overall **risk level** and **trust score** for their portfolio.

All of this information should be dynamically updated, **fetched directly from the contract address** provided by the user.

---

### **4. Data Processing and Refresh Flow**

* Every time the user provides a new **contract address**, the system must fetch **fresh, live data** from the backend.
* **Real-time Updates**: Ensure that as soon as any changes occur to the market data, trust scores, or price history (via blockchain data), the frontend is automatically updated with the latest data.
* **No Static or Mock Data**: **No mock data** should be displayed, even as placeholders. The UI should be **robust enough to handle missing data** (e.g., showing a loading spinner or a message like "Data fetching...").

---

### **5. Interactive UI/UX Features**

* **Charts and Graphs**: Implement **interactive charts** that allow users to hover over data points to see exact figures and trends.
* **Tooltips**: Add informative **tooltips** that appear when the user hovers over specific data points (e.g., price, trust score, or risk level), offering a brief explanation of what it represents.
* **Filter Options**: Allow users to filter historical data, trust scores, and price trends by time range (e.g., **last 7 days**, **last 30 days**, or **custom range**).
* **Color-Coded Risk Levels**: Use **color-coding** (e.g., green for low risk, yellow for medium risk, red for high risk) to make it easy for users to understand the data.
* **Graphical Representation**: Show **graphs, pie charts, and line charts** to visualize price trends, trust score distributions, and risk metrics.
* **Alerts**: Add a notification system that warns users if there are any significant **fraud alerts** or **price fluctuations** based on the real-time data.

---

### **6. Additional Considerations**

* **No Mock Data**: It is imperative that **no mock data** is used anywhere in the app. All data points must be dynamically fetched from the contract address using the backend analysis engine.
* **Real-time Interactions**: Any updates to the underlying data should be reflected **immediately on the frontend** without requiring page refreshes, ideally through technologies like **WebSockets** or **API polling**.
* **Clear Error Handling**: If data fetching fails (e.g., due to an invalid contract address or no data available), provide clear and concise error messages to the user.

---

### **Final Thoughts**

By emphasizing that **no mock data** is used, and that **all data** must be dynamically fetched from the provided contract address, this prompt ensures that the frontend is **fully data-driven**. This will give users the most accurate and up-to-date information about any NFT collection they want to analyze.

The **interactive UI** should allow users to explore and understand the data through easy-to-navigate sections and visually compelling charts, while providing real-time updates for a seamless experience.
